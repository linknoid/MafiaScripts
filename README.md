"# MafiaScripts" 

These are KoLmafia scripts I wrote for my own personal use.

LinknoidBarf.ash is for farming Barf Mountain for well equipped characters.
LinknoidMine.ash is for farming 1970s Volcano for poorly equipped characters.

The rest are just little utilities that I consider worth keeping around,
but I make no claims about their usefulness for anyone else.

Or you can just download the files manually and put them in your "scripts"
directory.
