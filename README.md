# MafiaScripts

These are KoLmafia scripts I wrote for my own personal use.

* LinknoidBarf.ash is for farming Barf Mountain for well equipped characters.
* LinknoidMine.ash is for farming 1970s Volcano for poorly equipped characters.
* LinknoidBounty.ash is for farming filthy lucre, with automatic zone unlocking and banishing and sniffing.  Not finished yet, so there's no official release branch.

The rest are just little utilities that I consider worth keeping around,
but I make no claims about their usefulness for anyone else.  Brief descriptions:

* breadcar.ash is so I can type breadcar 100 and it will add at least 100 fuel to my Asdon Marten by making soda bread.

* fight.ash is a relay script to modify "fight.php" pages to make LT&T unusual construct fights easier by adding the color of the sphere to use to the page text.  This could potentially interfere with another fight.ash script, so don't blame me if it breaks something.  I'm not sure the proper way to handle conflicts there.

* LinknoidDistension.ash is pretty trivial, it converts map of grimace prime into distension pills.

* LinknoidKarma.ash is my own Hardcore Community Service script.  Probably useless to anyone but my character, but if you want to code, feel free to use it as a starting point for your own script.

* LinknoidSleep.ash is my standard aftercore sleep routine so I don't have to do it manually every day.
