Configuration:

Both scripts share a common configuration file.  It will be created with the
settings it cares about the first run the script.  The file can be found in
the data folder:

"data\linknoidfarm_USERNAME.txt"

where USERNAME is the name of your current character.

Here's a brief explanation of values in file:

* abortOnBeatenUp - stops the script if you become beaten up to give you
  chance to fix what went wrong, otherwise it will heal you and keep running.
* allowExpensiveBuffs - if this is false, certain buffs will be considered off
  limits because the use expensive resources.
* autoConfirmBarf - skip past most of the user prompts and just use default
  values in the Barf script.
* autoConfirmMine - skip past most of the user prompts and just use default
  values in the Mine script.
* autoVoraciThanksgetting - automatically drink cuppa voraci tea to fit more
  thanksgetting after pantsgiving expands your stomach (almost certainly not
  worth the cost).
* combatUserScript - for the standard Barf Mountain combat filter, use your
  character's default combat script instead of the one built into the barf
  script (after copies are handled).
* defaultOutfit - the default outfit to use for Barf Mountain
* dropsOutput - the outfit to use when fighting 0 meat monsters (for bonus drops)
* executeAfterEat - allow custom script command to do any further eating or
  drinking after the Barf script does it's own eating.  This happens between
  Barf eating and drinking.
* executeBeforeEat - allow custom script to do any eating before the Barf
  script does any eating whatsoever, in case you want to completely override
  the diet.
* hobopolisWhitelist - which clans you're allowed into Hobopolis.
* manaOutfit - an outfit to maximize your mana and survive LOV tunnel
* maxUseEnamorings - how many enamorangs to use each day, since only 1 can be
  created per day, but many used.
* maxUsePrintScreens - how many print screens to use each day, since only 1
  can be created per day, but many used.
* meatyOutfit - default outfit to use for fighting embezzlers.  If this is
  blank, it will use the default outfit instead.
* preferCalcUniversePvP - since Calculate the Universe changes as you spend
  turns, it makes sense to execute it while you can.  If you set this to true
  and have broken your hippy stone, it will choose 3 PvP fights instead of 3
  adventures.
* printColor - the color to send messages in, defaults to orange for contrast
  and visibility against a white background with black text.
* sacramentoLimit - max number of sacramento wines to drink per day.  They
  probably aren't worth drinking for their cost while farming barf mountain,
  but you can specify your own limit if you wish.
* saveLiver - how many drunkenness to save for other purposes.  Useful when
  you want to consume other stuff afte.
* saveSpleen - how many spleen to save for other purposes.  Useful when you
  want to consume other stuff after.
* saveStomach - how many fullness to save for other purposes.  Useful when you
  want to consume other stuff after.
* thanksgettingFoodCostLimit - maximum to pay for a single unique
  Thanksgetting food.  If a food is over the limit, it will substitute cheaper
  foods for duration, while losing out on buff size.  If you specify -1, it
  will not check the mall, and only use cornucopias you already have.
* mojoCostLimit - maximum to pay for a mojo filter on the mall.  If you
  specify -1, it will not check the mall, and only use mojo filters you
  already have.
* turkeyLimit - max number of ambitious turkeys to drink per day.  If you're
  getting 4 or 5 of them from your turkey a day, you might want to set it
  higher, but it defaults to 1.
* weightOutfit - an outfit to maximize weight for free runaways and NPZR free
  combats.



LinknoidBarf.ash:

This is a meat farming script.  It's focused on running Barf Mountain and
copying embezzlers, and providing the buffs to optimize doing so, especially
the complicated eating that goes into a Thanksgetting feast.

The Mayo Clinic is probably the single most important IotM for making this
script work.  Without it, your eating is going to be very less optimal.
Pantsgiving is also quite useful, but not so critical.

My design philosophy:  I want the script to be resilient, but I don't want it
doing stuff with my account without permission.  It's allowed to buy necessary
resources from the mall or NPCs or coinmasters, but it will never auto-sell or
put anything on the mall.  I'm something of a packrat (for example, I like
collecting solid gold jewels, I don't want them used automatically).  If you
want to automatically sell stuff, you'll need a separate script for that.

My scripts will pop up warning messages to continue or abort in certain
situations.  It will not change your workshed item, it won't run your
Robortender without drinks, it won't buy a day pass, it won't drink without
Ode to Booze, it won't eat without Mayo clinic installed, it won't run the
gingerbread city, it won't maximimize your Summon Resolutions, any of these
things WITHOUT your permission.



Usage:


 Prompts for:
 * number of turns to buff (-1 to buff with "night before" buffs, basically
   the minimum number of turns because we're just doing free kills).
 * number of turns to execute (-1 to only burn your free kills for the day)
 * which familiar to use (if blank, it chooses the Robortender if buffing for
   at least 100 turns, or you've fed Robortender a drive-by shooting already
   today, otherwise the hobo monkey if you have it, otherwise a leprechaun).

There are a number of prompts to warn you of important things, and give you a
chance to cancel.  I recommend leaving them enabled at the beginning, but if
you don't want interactivity, you can let the script use defaults by setting
property "autoConfirmBarf" to true in the configuration file (in the data
directory, see above).

 * Auto-buy/use one-day ticket if you don't have charter
 * Auto-buy a print screen button using 111 BACON if available (assumes you have
   an infinite bacon machine)
 * Turns in a trash for 3 fun funds
 * Takes the lube shoes quest (and completes it if you run enough turns)

If you specify a negative number turns of buff, it will provide minimum 1
turn of each buff, including some more expensive ones (like Mick's Inhaler)
only used in this scenario. This is meant as "night before" buffing, when you
still have a bunch of embezzler copies to fight, and can then turn around the
next day and use those same buffs on more embezzlers, all without using any
turns.


 Standard buff package (you're responsible for having a stockpile of variable cost stuff like Be Wealthier, etc.):
 * Summon Preturnatural Greed demon
 * Concert Winklered buff
 * Game grid token
 * Asdon Martin: Driving Observantly
 * Knob Goblin Nasal Spray
 * Knob Goblin Pet Buffing Spray
 * Resolution: Be Wealthier (full turns if you have Libram of Resolutions, or
   just 1 use (20 turns) if you don't)
 * How to Scam Tourists
 * Polka of Plenty
 * Leon's Phat Loot
 * The Ballad of Richie Thingfinder (if you're an AT with that skill, not from recording)
 * The Chorale of Companionship (if you're an AT with that skill, not from recording)
 * Mad Hatter Dances With Tweedles
 * Source Terminal: Meat.enh
 * Glenn's Golden Dice
 * Incredible Self Esteem skill, only if "Always Be Collecting" buff is active
 * Flaskfull of Hollow (if half a purse is part of "Barf" outfit)
 * Leash of Linguini
 * Sweet Synthesis (+300% meat)
 * KGB "A View to Some Meat" buff (requires Ezandora's KGB control script),
   and the rest of clicks go to +item
 * Crazy Horse from horsery unless you already have a horse
 * Summon lasagna/spice ghost if a pastamancer, and the lasagna buff for
   embezzlers if you have the skill and mana (10 turns of 10% for 200 mana)
 * Use Bag O' Tricks, Yendorian Express card, License to Chill to increase buff lengths
 * Clan pool table for familiar weight
 * Clan fortune teller for meat buff

 * Eats optimized using Mayo Clinic (and with milk of magnesium):
 * Jumping Horseradish: Kicked in the Sinuses
 * Thanksgiving Feast (including buying and/or cooking)
 * Configurable number of Ambitious Turkey, defaults to 1
 * 1 Dirt Julep (low turn gen, but good buff)
 * 1 Gingerbread wine if you have it (untradable booze from gingerbread city)
 * Fills rest of liver with Sacramento wine
 * Activates Shrine to the Barrel God before eating or drinking, if appropriate class
 * Wears Mafia Pinky Ring before drinking
 * If you don't have Ode to Booze, it will send Buffy 2000 meat and request Ode befure drinking
 * If you have both PokeGarden and Thanksgarden, swaps to PokeGarden to get
   fertilizer before spending turns, and then back to Thanksgarden with 1
   day's growth after completion.

If you specify more than 320 turns and have pantsgiving with standard 15 size
stomach, it will run 5 adventures and then use a distention pill to either
time-spinner (if possible), or eat (if no time spinner) another serving of
thanksgiving, for up to 340 turns of Thanksgetting buff.

You can manually go up to 380 turns Thankgetting on a size 15 stomach with
Pantsgiving (stop and manually eat after 50 turns gives another fullness
available), but it takes a cuppa Voracity, which is currently worth more than
40 turns of Thansgetting.  You can make the script do this automatically if
you turn on the "autoVoraciThanksgetting" setting.

It will use the Adson Martin instakill before switching to Mayo Clinic, and
eat one last mayozapine and buy a sphygmayomonometer before swapping out the
mayo clinic.

 It will make and use copies of Knob Goblin Embezzlers from the following sources:
 * Chateau (fight only, not make painting)
 * 4-d camera (1/day)
 * Rain Doh (5/day)
 * Spooky Putty (5/day) (or a total of 6 with Rain Doh/Spooky Putty combined)
 * LOV Enamorang (1/day)
 * Print Screen Button (1/day)
 * Digitize (re-digitize every 97 turns)
 * Obtuse Angel (should also be able to handle Reanimated Reanimator if that's
   an option, but don't have one to test with)

Wears scratch'n'sniff UPC codes if they're cost effective while fighting
Embezzlers (not cost effective for Barf Mountain itself)

Casts Meteor Storm on embezzlers for +20 familiar weight

Increases monster level before initial embezzlers to try to stop them from
dying prematurely.


If you have a Robortender, it will try to fight an elf for the first fight,
although there doesn't appear to be a way to find out if it's the
Robortender's first fight of the day or not.  It will copy the elf and fight
it a second time if possible, since there's a good chance of getting a second
peppermint sprig on a the second kill.  If you capture a crayon elf in your
chateau painting, it will use that elf, since they don't cost a turn.
Otherwise, if you have a deck of every card, it will fight a random elf from
there, and use free kills (like shattering punch) to avoid wasting buff turns.


It will also use free kills to extend the buff duration: (THIS IS NOW DISABLED BECAUSE OF 1000 MEAT LIMIT FOR FREE COMBATS)
 * Jokester's Gun
 * Replica Bat-oomerang
 * Shattering Punch
 * Gingerbread Mob Hit
 * Asdon Martin: Missile Launcher


Since each person has different outfit names and such, those can be
configured in the settings file (in the data directory).  By default, the
outfit names it looks for are:
 * Barf - should be your meat maximization outfit, it swaps out the cheap
   sunglasses when you're fighting embezzlers.
 * Max MP - maximize your MP for libram casting.  Which means it also gets
   worn in LOV tunnel, so be prepared.
 * Max Weight - maximize your weight for NPRZ dancing, which might mean you
   need a bit of survivability in there.
 * Drops - an outfit which provides item drops in situations where the base
   monster provides no meat or need for +item%


If outfit "Barf" contains an accordion and a bakelite backpack, it will
execute accordion bash in each combat.

If outfit "Barf" contains a Haiku Katana or Patriot Shield, or you're a seal
clubber, it will use the crit ability each combat.

It will replace accessory 1 with mayfly bait when visiting running barf
mountain until the swarms are used up for the day.

Uses free combat (witchess or snojo) before each digitize to activate bag o'
tricks "Badger Underfoot" buff.

Optionally clear gingerbread to grab candies, and if you have the Gingerbread
Best outfit, a chocolate sculpture (if you have 300 sprinkles) or gingerbread
wine (if you don't have the sprinkles). Useful because you will normally have
a large number of pet buffs. Requires Bandersnatch or Stomping Boots, or a
supply of fish-oil smoke bombs from the AT nemesis quest.

Feeds Robortender if he's your familiar with the following bonuses:
 * + meat
 * + item
 * mana regen
 * hobo drops
 * candy drops
It will only use drinks from that list you actually have, otherwise you will
get prompted to continue without them (in case the mall prices aren't worth
it)

Grabs a pirate costume if trick-or-treating tot is your familiar.
Doesn't cast familiar weight buffs if using tot.

 

 Visits protonic accelorator pack quest adventures, uses combat with a "drops"
 familiar in this priority:
 * Baby Sand Worm
 * Fist Turkey
 * Space Jellyfish (if elemental)
 * Intergnat
 * Rockin' Robin

 And Crown of Throns or Buddy Bjorn for drops in this order:
 * Garbage fire
 * Optimistic candle
 * Trick-or-treating Tot
 * Machine Elf
 * Warbear Drone

 Before casting buffs, automatically equips Oscus's outfit for -5 MP cost, KGB
 for -3 MP cost (or orcish rubber if that's not available), and brimstone
 bracelet for -3 MP cost.

 If you have libram of resolutions, auto-burn mana between combats.
 * Uses source terminal Turbo.enh if it can use the mana for summons

 Also does massive mana burning via summon resolution at the beginning with maxing out MP:
 * Telescope look high
 * Cross the Streams (protonic pack)
 * Sweet synthesis +300% myst and +300% MP (if spleen available)
 * Spacagate vaccine +50% myst
 * Hawking's +200% myst
 * Ointment of the Occult +100% myst
 * Tomato Juice +50% myst
 * Glittery Mascera +15% myst
 * Oil of slipperiness or Oil of stability as necessary
 * Circle Drum
 * Jump in the ball pit

And restores mana using:
 * Free rests (using Pilgrim hat if available, else Chateau if available, else
   normal rest), wearing Pantsgiving if available.
 * nuns
 * Clan hot shower
 * oscus' soda
 * eternal car battery
 * Yendorian Express card
 * License to Chill
 * and LOV tunnel

 Semi-rares: Automatically goes to castle in the clouds top floor when
 semi-rare timer expires.  If last semi-rare was Mick's, it visits purple light
 district if available, or knob treasury if not.  Or billiards room if you
 haven't gotten your perm pool skill to 10.  You must edit the settings file
 with hobopolisWhitelist=guildName if you want it to visit the purple light
 district (although maybe that's silly, you have to have gone through the
 sewers anyway to get there)

 Automatically removes effects and items which confuse KoLMafia.
 Particularly, Papier Mitre gives +familiar weight, but it will cause all kinds
 of problems if you wear it while scripting.

 Accordion Buffs get shrugged if necessary to fit songs in head.  Won't shrug
 Thingfinder, Chorale, Polka, and Phat Loot.

 It will skip past Spookyraven quest if the counter is turned on, so it won't
 interrupt the script, but it will leave your Spookyraven setting alone.

 In combat:
 * pickpockets
 * casts source terminal extract
 * uses Pantsgiving pocket crumbs
 * uses the appropriate critical hit source if wearing mafia ring





LinknoidMine.ash:

This is a 1970s volcano mining script.  There are others more advanced, but I
just wanted something that would work.  The one I tried kept complaining about
object detection not found.  I started from Smelltastic's hotmine, and added a
bunch of automation to gear up, eat, drink, spleen, and borrow time before
doing the mining.  It also gets a volcoino using the velvet outfit (if you
have torso awareness), and tries to get a second volcoino if it can buy (or
has) the items for a bunker quest, and then buys another ticket if you have
enough volcoinos.

You can skip the eat/drink/spleen part completely if you don't want it doing it.  Here's what it will do if you let it:
  * It will eat hi meins on Monday, and lasagna with field of gar the rest of the week.  With milk of magnesium.
  * It will drink perfect ice drinks (by price) and then top off with cheapest robortender drinks, with Ode to booze, paying Buffy a 2000 meat gift if you don't have the Ode skill.
  * It will spleen using powdered gold, agua de vida, and carrot juice as a finisher
  * It will borrow time 20 turns from tomorrow (with your permission)

If you specify turns as -1, it will instead run until you're out of turns.  If
you run out of turns, the last thing it will do is switch to outfit "Sleep".
